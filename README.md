# uoft-prereq-planner
For UofT Courses to aid students in course and program selection.

At this point, we have already created a database which was fed data from our scraper.

The right questions to ask:
- we want to build a front end and back end. 
- the front end will allow the user to type in a course that they are interested in. As well as visually display that courses' reverse-prerequisites
- The backend will take the inputted course code, and query the database, and produce the reverse-prerequisites for the course, then we resupply the front end with the information.
